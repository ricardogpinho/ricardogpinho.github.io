**14** incredible weeks just flew by...

It was an amazing journey.
I think I have never learn this much in such a short period of time. I can't say it was easy, because there were difficult moments, and learning is never easy, but it was... fulfilling, I think that's the word. 
I met incredible people, passionate for programming and living.

Here are some the masterpieces I drew in my free time ðŸ˜…!
