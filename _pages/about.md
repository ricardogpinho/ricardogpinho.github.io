Feel free to check my blog to see what i'm currently working on, or simply to see what is currently crossing my mind. Also fell free to check my projects, to see what crossed my mind before.

I'm a software developper, I can write stuff in C, Java, and mess with most of those Web tools minefields and their respective programming languages. I am still learning, everyday, of course. Who doesn't? Trump I guess...

FCP is the best. That's football, or soccer, depending where you're from.

I'm Portuguese. I don't know if that's relevant.
